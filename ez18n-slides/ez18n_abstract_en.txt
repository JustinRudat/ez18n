Based on some real life stories and best practices collected while coding java applications we have the following stories for you :
Story 1: Mr Apt loves you !  APT Processing explained
* When and how to use the APT tooling, a smart code generator built-in in the JDK.
Story 2: Tango Charly i18n : i18n and encoding survivor guide
* Critical information to know about i18n and encoding hell.
* Some ideas some manage mass i18n management (Crowdsourcing) : how to easily receive high quality contributions from your users. 
Story 3: I18n swiss knife : the ez18n project
* an annotation toolset to forget ".properties" files for the rest of your life, with a sample on how to enable multi-device localisation (desktop/mobile for en).

All this to show you how i18n management can lead to fun situations and some interesting tooling, and why not more business for all.
